# Imp-Bot
Imp Bot is a water vessel designed to collect water samples from a depth of 1 metre and 2 metres. The vessel can be controlled with an Android application wirelessly via Bluetooth. The code outlined here is for the Arduino board on the vessel, which controls the motors and a GPS Shield installed on the vessel.

In the file "main.ino" you can find the source code for the Arduino program. The Android application was made using MIT App Inventor and more information can be found here: https://endteamsix.wordpress.com/electrical-electronic-design/
